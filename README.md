# About
This repository contains the Master's thesis and the R code pertaing to it. The thesis was written as part of my Master's in Statistical Science and Data Science at Leiden University between February 



## THESIS: Match Making
Pdf file of master's thesis


## R functions
[Functions](/matching_simulation_functions.R)
Functions for performing the simulations

## Simulations on uniform data (sample size, ratio, caliper, treatment effect size)
[simulations_1](https://github.com/laura-ruth/LJS_thesis/blob/main/simulations1.Rmd)
MC simulations for uniformly distributed data comparing 3 matching methods. Parameters are sample size, ratio, caliper size, and treatment effect size. 

## Overlap simulations for uniform data
[simulations_2](/simulations2_overlap_uniform.Rmd)
MC simulations on overlap for the uniform distribution
