# About
This repository contains the Master's thesis and the R code pertaing to it. The thesis was written as part of my Master's in Statistical Science and Data Science at Leiden University between February 



## THESIS: Match Making
Pdf file of master's thesis


## R functions [Functions](/matching_simulation_functions.R)

Functions for performing the simulations

## Simulations on uniform data (sample size, ratio, caliper, treatment effect size)[simulations_1](https://github.com/laura-ruth/LJS_thesis/blob/main/simulations1.Rmd)

MC simulations for uniformly distributed data comparing 3 matching methods. Parameters are sample size, ratio, caliper size, and treatment effect size. 

## Simulations on uniform data with control to treated ratio 1:1 and large sample size [ratio_1_to_1](https://github.com/laura-ruth/LJS_thesis/blob/main/unif_large_n_ratio1.Rmd)

MC simulations comparing ther 3 matching methods when the ratio is 1:1 for sample sizes from 10 to 1010. 

## Overlap simulations for uniform data [simulations_2](/simulations2_overlap_uniform.Rmd)
MC simulations on overlap for the uniform distribution

## Interaction Simulations [interaction_simulations](https://github.com/laura-ruth/LJS_thesis/blob/main/Interaction_Simulations.Rmd)
MC simulations looking at the effect of different levels of interaction on the estimates produced by the 3 matching methods.

## Propensity simulations [Propensity_simulations](https://github.com/laura-ruth/LJS_thesis/blob/main/propensity%20_simulations.Rmd)

Investigations into the propensity score as implemented in R.
